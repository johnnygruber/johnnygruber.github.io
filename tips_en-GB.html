        Below we have compiled a few tips about <span class="italic">interval training</span> for you.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        
        <p>
        In daily training many runners make the mistake to always <span class="italic">run at the same pace</span>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In the long term this results in a <span class="italic">stop</span> of power and no real increase in fitness.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        One of the most effective methods to achieve <span class="italic">performance improvement</span> is the interval training.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
        The <span class="italic"> interval training </span> is a switch of <span class="italic">fast</span> running phases with <span class="italic">slow</span> trot or walk breaks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        So a loading and unloading in a <span class="italic">balanced</span> mix.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        By the <span class="italic">load peaks</span> the body is brought beyond its borders and adapts to the new strain.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        You should first start with the interval training if you are able to run at least <span class="italic">half an hour</span> at a time without any problems.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Anyone who is unsure should definitely consult a <span class="italic">doctor </span> to check his fitness before he starts the training. If there are no medical objections, you can start.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        If you are already running three times a week, you can replace one workout with an interval training.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Intervall training pases</h3>
        
        <p>
        Interval training consists of <span class="italic">three</span> phases:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Warm up</li>
            <li>High speed phase followed by a low speed recovery period - several repetitions</li>
            <li>Cool down</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Warm up</h3>
        
        <p>
        Start the interval training always with a warm up unit in the <span class="italic"> endurance pace </span>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Ideal for example, are <span class="italic"> two </span> kilometers in the quiet pace.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Your muscles <span class="italic"> heated </span> and the cardiovascular system gets used to it <span class="italic"> slow </span> to the increasing demand.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Length of high speed units</h3>
        
        <p>
        You can do </span> interval training based on a certain time or a given <span class="italic"> distance.
            </p>
        
        <p>
        The IntervallLogger app uses the <span class="italic">distance model</span>. You define the respective path lengths of the various units for your training <span class="italic">individual</span>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The tempo units can extend from 50 meters to 3000 meters.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Units of <span class="italic"> 50 </span> meters to <span class="italic">1000 </span> promote the development of the <span class="italic"> speed </span> (anaerobic training).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Longer loads from <span class="italic"> 1000 </span> meters are primarily the <span class="italic">endurance training </span> (aerobic training).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        A <span class="italic"> good </span> load distance is eg. <span class="italic"> 400 </span> meters.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This distance is especially suitable for <span class="italic">beginners</span> in interval training.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Not overdo it with the pace. Remember, this rate should also be able to retain in the last iteration.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Length of slow units</h3>
        
        <p>
        A good and simple method is the same length as line to vote at the pace unit (Principle <span class="italic"> load = discharge </span>).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The pace in the recovery period can or should be perfectly <span class="italic"> very slow </span> be, for example, Traben slow or fast walking.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        But stay on all cases in <span class="italic"> motion </span>, as can be degraded more quickly in the muscle lactate accumulated by the movement.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Number of repetitions</h3>
        
        <p>
        A good <span class="italic"> home </span> in the interval training include <span class="italic"> five </span> replicates of <span class="italic"> 400 </span> meters and load <span class="italic"> 400 </span> meters recovery period.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        If you (<span class="italic"> 200 </span> e.g. meters) choose a shorter load units, you can certainly even more reps plan (eg, <span class="italic"> ten </span>).
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Cool down</h3>
        
        <p>
        Complete the interval training always with a unit in the <span class="italic"> endurance pace </span>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Are ideal, as well as the warm-up, <span class="italic"> two </span> kilometers in the quiet pace.
        </p>
